# locked-mode-x
Locked Mode X is a simple bypass for Google's locked mode! It works as of the latest chromeOS version, v132. <br>
**THEY WILL NOT FIX THIS EXPLOIT. I TRIED GETTING THEM TO DO SO BUT THEY CLOSED MY ISSUE.**

## Discovery:
- In Economics, I had a quiz in locked mode. After I did it, I decided to make my own locked mode quiz and try some things to escape it.
- After a while, I found the exploit below...

## Instructions:
- ONLY USE THIS FOR EDUCATIONAL PURPOSES
  
1. Open two windows of the locked form.
2. Click both of their continue buttons at the EXACT same time. Too late and it'll work as normal. <br>
   You should practise first by creating your own locked forms and previewing them. <br>
   This exploit is probably only possible on touch screen due to how quick you need to be. <br>
4. You should be in locked mode now, but it will only show a blank window with a forms icon at the bottom left. Click it.
5. It should now show the enter locked mode screen on the form when you're already in locked mode. Click continue.
6. Click the overview button on your keyboard. You'll be able to see all the windows, and hence "exit" locked mode. You can still return to the form and complete it.

- GOOGLE UPDATED GOOGLE FORMS AND NOW LOCKED MODE DOESN'T WORK WITH NEW PREVIEWED FORMS. IT WILL STILL WORK ON OLD FORMS. IT WILL BE HARDER TO PRACTISE, BUT THIS EXPLOIT IS NOT PATCHED. <br> 

## Notes:
-> You cannot screenshot until you complete the form properly ('submit' or 'close quiz')! (Note: I found this independently from LoMoH) <br>
-> Alt-tab closes the quiz, use the window view button! <br>
-> This is very buggy! <br>
-> You might notice that locked mode is an app called Assessment Assistant (https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/assessment-assistant-dev/ibnfdimnablpmgpmgegnbdadookdffie) <br>
