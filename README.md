# locked-mode-x
Locked Mode X is a simple bypass for Google's locked mode! It works as of September 8th 2025 in chromeOS v139. <br>
**THEY WILL NOT FIX THIS EXPLOIT. I TRIED GETTING GOOGLE TO DO SO BUT THEY CLOSED MY ISSUE.**

## Discovery:
- In Economics, I had a quiz in locked mode. After I did it, I decided to make my own locked mode quiz and try some things to escape it.
- After a while, I found the exploit below...

## Instructions:
1. Open two windows of the locked form.
2. Click both of their continue buttons at the EXACT same time. Too late and it'll work as normal. <br>
   You should practise first by creating your own locked forms and previewing them. <br>
   This exploit is probably only possible on touch screen due to how quick you need to be. <br>
4. You should be in locked mode now, but it will only show a blank window with a forms icon at the bottom left. Click it.
5. It should now show the enter locked mode screen on the form when you're already in locked mode. Click continue.
6. Click the overview button on your keyboard. You'll be able to see all the windows, and hence "exit" locked mode. However, you can still return to the form and complete it.

## Notes:
-> You cannot screenshot until you complete the form properly ('submit' or 'close quiz')! <br>

-> Alt-tab closes the quiz, use the window view button! <br>

-> This is very buggy! <br>

-> You might notice that locked mode is an app called Assessment Assistant (https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/assessment-assistant-dev/ibnfdimnablpmgpmgegnbdadookdffie) <br>

-> GOOGLE UPDATED GOOGLE FORMS AND NOW LOCKED MODE DOESN'T WORK WITH NEW PREVIEWED FORMS. IT WILL STILL WORK ON OLD FORMS. IT WILL BE HARDER TO PRACTISE THE TIMINGS, BUT THIS EXPLOIT IS NOT PATCHED. <br> 

-> I don't care about what you do with this exploit since apparently this bug was too minor for Google to bother to fix it when I asked them. <br>
